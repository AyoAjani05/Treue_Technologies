# Treue_Technologies_Internship

I want to express my gratitude for the opportunities to engage in meaningful projects. The following text summaries highlight the potential of data analytics and artificial intelligence in various domains:

- Bank Churn Prediction: Over the years, bank churn rates have steadily increased. However, with AI and data analytics, there's a powerful tool to minimize churn rates. The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate model for predicting customer churn in the banking industry.

- House Price Prediction: House prices have displayed significant fluctuations and trends. Utilizing advanced data analytics and AI, we aim to develop a highly accurate model for forecasting house prices in the real estate industry.

- Startup Success Prediction: Startups play a pivotal role in shaping industries, but their journey is fraught with challenges. This project aims to develop a highly accurate model for forecasting startup success rates, leveraging data analytics and AI to navigate the complex startup landscape.

In each project, the goal is to provide valuable insights and predictive models that empower decision-makers in their respective industries.

Certainly, here's a transition statement to provide information about the code's environment and how it can be run:

"All the code mentioned in the previous text summaries was developed and executed in Google Colab, offering the convenience of running the code both remotely and locally. If you prefer to run the code locally on your machine, you can follow these steps:

**Installation and Configuration:**

1. **Download Anaconda:** Start by downloading Anaconda from [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and install the required libraries listed in the 'requirement.txt' file using PIP.

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook:** To work with Jupyter Notebook, you'll need to install it. You can do this by running one of the following commands in your Anaconda environment:

    ```
    conda install jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```
    pip install jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, you can launch it to view and run the '.ipynb' files containing the code."

This information provides guidance on how to set up the environment and run the code either remotely or locally using Jupyter Notebook.
