# House_Price_Prediction

This project was completed as part of Treue Technologies Internship.
## Introduction
> Over the years, house prices have displayed significant fluctuations and trends. However, with the utilization of advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, there is a potent tool to understand and potentially predict these price movements. House price prediction, powered by data-driven insights and AI algorithms, offers a proactive approach to grasp the dynamics of real estate markets.<br>
In this project, our primary objective is to develop a highly accurate model for forecasting house prices in the real estate industry. By analyzing historical data, encompassing property features, location details, market trends, and economic indicators, we aim to unveil valuable insights and key factors that influence property prices. This predictive model will enable stakeholders, such as buyers, sellers, and investors, to make informed decisions, optimize investments, and navigate the real estate market with confidence.<br>
The ultimate goal is to provide a tool that contributes to a deeper understanding of house price movements, helping individuals and organizations alike to make well-informed decisions in the dynamic and ever-changing real estate landscape.
